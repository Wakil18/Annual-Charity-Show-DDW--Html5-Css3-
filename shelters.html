                <p class="shelter"> In the United Kingdom there is hardly any government-run organization that provides oversight or regulation of the various shelters on a national basis. However, many individual states do regulate shelters within their jurisdiction. One of the earliest comprehensive measures was the Georgia Animal Protection Act of 1986. The law was enacted in response to the inhumane treatment of companion animals by a pet store chain in Atlanta. The Act provided for the licensing and regulation of pet shops, stables, kennels, and animal shelters, and established, for the first time, minimum standards of care. <img src="img/1.jpg" alt=""></p>

                        <h3>How We Collect Fund Throughout The Year</h3>
                        <p>Fundraising events are a popular form of fundraising. While they can be great money makers for an organization, they can also be time consuming and expensive. The success of events depends on careful planning. (Yes, you should have a written event plan for every event you hold!)Before doing anything else, you must decide what the purpose of your event is. Is this truly a fundraising event? Or does it have other goals? Perhaps your organization may be hoping to raise money at the event, but the main function of the event is to gain publicity, or reach out to a new network. Many charitable events have more than one goal. Figuring out the details for your event will depend on knowing what goals you are trying to achieve.</p>

                    <h3>Our Shelters Around The World</h3>
                    <p>Despite below freezing water temperatures, brave bathers raise thousands of pounds for charities.Street art has become very popular in recent years and people have been utilising this popularity to run charity street art events, often called paint jams. The idea is to bring together a number of street artists to paint live, drawing in fans to watch these artists in action. By adding a raffle or an auction whilst the paint jam is going, is a great way to bring in extra cash from the event, just like at this paint jam.</p>
