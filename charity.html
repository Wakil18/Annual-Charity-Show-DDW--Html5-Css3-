                    1. PEER-TO-PEER FUNDRAISING: Peer-to-peer fundraising is perfect for all types of event fundraising! Common ideas include walkathons, bikeathons, thanks giving challenge, or fun runs. P2P fundraising encourages donors to reach out to their friends and family to engage a larger community in their fundraising effort. <a href="#">&nbsp; &nbsp; Register for this event</a><br><br>
                    2. CREATE CUSTOM T-SHIRTS: Adding unique gear like t-shirts can be a great addition to your next fundraising event. T-Shirts can pair with your existing fundraising efforts or be an add-on item provided to volunteers or teams. The nice part about custom gear is that it gives participants something to keep as a memento after the event is over.<a href="#">&nbsp; &nbsp; Register for this event</a><br><br>
                    3. CROWDFUNDING: Crowdfunding campaigns are a great way to engage a large population of small dollar donors. They work well when paired with annual fundraising events. Best of all, they're inexpensive to create and rely on social sharing. Crowdfunding campaigns have the potential to go viral and raise a lot of money.<a href="#">&nbsp; &nbsp; Register for this event</a><br><br>
                    4. CHARITY AUCTIONS: Auctions are some of the most profitable fundraising events around. With so many amazing prizes on the line, donors won’t be able to resist contributing to your cause. Plan ahead to get the best auction items and start planning your next charity event today!<a href="#">&nbsp; &nbsp; Register for this event</a><br><br>
                    5. TAKE THE DOG WALK CHALLENGE: You and your dog have the power to change the lives of the world’s most vulnerable working horses, donkeys and mules. Walk 10,000 steps every day with your canine friend for a month and raise £100 for Brooke.<a href="#">&nbsp; &nbsp; Register for this event</a><br><br>
                    6. CAMPUS CARNIVAL: Ladies and gentlemen, sisters and brothers, step right up to your next major fundraising event — a campus carnival! It’ll take a strong team to coordinate the event. To help disperse responsibilities, partner with a few other sororities and fraternities and make it a team effort. Put together a planning committee with representatives from all participating Greek organizations to ensure that all parties have a voice and the carnival goes off without a hitch.<a href="#">&nbsp; &nbsp; Register for this event</a>

                    Charities up and down the country capitalised on the (crazy) tradition of Boxing Day swims last year, by organising charity dips. Themes range from Pirates and Princesses to Angels and Santas. Despite below freezing water temperatures, brave bathers raise thousands of pounds for charities.Street art has become very popular in recent years and people have been utilising this popularity to run charity street art events, often called paint jams. The idea is to bring together a number of street artists to paint live, drawing in fans to watch these artists in action. By adding a raffle or an auction whilst the paint jam is going, is a great way to bring in extra cash from the event, just like at this paint jam.
