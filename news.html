                    <h3>REASONS TO ADOPT A DOG</h3>
                    <div>
                    <p>Finding yourself in the position to finally adopt a furry friend is always an exciting time - but have you ever considered adopting a rescue dog, instead of buying one 'new'?
There are so many advantages to adopting a rescue dog, and this is why many people prefer adopting unwanted dogs rather than buying new puppies. <br><br>

                        <strong>1. It's a rewarding thing to do</strong><br>
'Rehoming a vulnerable and unwanted dog is an amazing thing to do', say officials at the Battersea Dogs and Cats Home. 'It gives a dog a second chance at a happier life, and in rehoming a dog you’re aiding in the fight against Back Street Breeding.<br><br>

<strong>2. Support, training and advice</strong><br>
Adopting a dog from a recognised dog charity also means that you will have support for you and your dog (even after your dog has moved in with you), with expert advice and support.<br><br>

<strong>3. Lifelong friendship</strong><br>
There are huge benefits to dog ownership for us too. 'If you rehome a rescue dog they will repay your kindness and patience in rebuilding their confidence with loyalty, fun and above all friendship', say Dogs Trust.<br><br>

<strong>4. Good deed</strong><br>
By adopting a dog from a charity, you are supporting their work, and therefore a good cause.<br><br>

<strong>5. There are too many unwanted dogs</strong><br>
There are 600 million stray dogs across the world so adopting one without a home helps reduce this number, and also reduces the reliance on the dreadful puppy farming industry.</p>

                <h3> Adopt a Dog From ACS </h3>
                <p>Each year, 2.7 million adoptable dogs and cats are euthanized in the United States, simply because too many pets come into shelters and too few people consider adoption when looking for a pet. The number of euthanized animals could be reduced dramatically if more people adopted pets instead of buying them.
                Your Adoption means a lot to us and definitey it means more than a lot for the pet you will adopt. In return of adopting a dog you will be able to joint next two events after adoption for Free!!! and not only that, actually the greatest thing you will get in return of adopting this dog is you will get the bestest friend of your whole life who will never ever leave you no matter what. So don't waste time, visist ACS and adopt a pet.</p>

                <h3>How's Tom now!!!</h3>
                <p>Last year we rescued Tom from a random road where he was on the ground bleeding. Maybe he was attacked by some type of wolf.  A member of our ACS called the nearest shelter and let us know about him and quickly we dispatched our rescue and medic team and rescued Tom. But, look how much improvement he has made just in one year! Isn't that amazing!!!</p>
